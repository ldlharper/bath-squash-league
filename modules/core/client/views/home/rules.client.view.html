         The squash league is played to the <a href="101102_Singles-Rules-V5.pdf">World Squash Federation Singles Rules</a> though we use the English 'Server only Scores' scoring system and not the American PAR (Point a Rally) system. Details of the 'Server only Scores' scoring system can be found in Appendix 7 (page 39) of the <a href="101102_Singles-Rules-V5.pdf">World Squash Federation Singles Rules</a>.

   <li>
      <p>
         All matches are the best of 5 games, played with the double yellow spot ball, unless both players agree to use a different type.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         The score at the end of court time stands, unless both players agree to a re-match.

   <li>
      <p>
         League cycles run for a period of 5 weeks. There is usually a week break in between cycles. Over holiday periods, the league may be extended.

      <p>
         A walkover is given to a player if their opponent fails to turn up without giving reasonable prior notice (48hrs or as agreed). Walkovers will be awarded at the discretion of the organisers.

         The following promotion/relegation outline applies:<br>
         <strong>Winner/Runner-up move up 1 division<br>
         Bottom 2 move down 1 division</strong>
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>There are rare instances when the above rule doesn't apply, usually when  a division has to contain 5 or 7 players, though we try to be as consistent as possible.</p>

      <p>
         In the event of points being tied between two or more players at the end of the cycle, positions will be determined based on the following criteria:<br>
         a)&nbsp; Winner of the game between players tied<br>
         b)&nbsp; Player with more victories<br>
         c)&nbsp; Player who played most matches<br>
         d)&nbsp; If STILL equal â€“ then, a play-off OR the Organiser's discretion decides.

         Players not completing their full quota of matches <em>may</em> be excluded from future cycles.
