<h2>About the league</h2>
<p>The Bath Squash League is a friendly and active mixed league, based at the Bath Sports and Leisure Centre in the centre of Bath.</p>
<p>It'ss free to join but we ask that members <a href="#donate">make a small donation</a> to help cover website hosting and admin costs.<br>
</p>
<p>Players of all levels are welcome to join and we currently have around 85 members from Bath, Bristol and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The league predominantly caters for local players who are available throughout the year, with most matches being played during midweek evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>The league consists of divisions of six players with each cycle running for five weeks, followed by a one week break whilst the new tables are produced.&nbsp; The top two players in each division at the end of the cycle will be promoted, and the bottom two players relegated.</p>
<p>New joining players are placed in a 'New Players Division', before being incorporated into the main league structure.&nbsp; For new players who would expect to be suited to playing towards the top divisions, it may take a few cycles of playing in the lower divisions before an opportunity comes to move up.&nbsp; We'd encourage you to drop us an email to discuss opportunites for being fast tracked up the league if you are well used to playing at a higher level.</p>
<p>League members are expected to complete all of their allocated matches, and those players that play no matches in a single cycle, or consistently play less than the alloted amount over a number of cycles, will be removed.</p>
